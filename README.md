# wood_formation_phenology
a place to think about whether wood phenology is circular, or just wood rings.

##Usage notes
- add the ERA_export_pnas_clim_08_20_2020.csv to your own personal /data directory; *it is too big for git* and will be ignored in the .gitignore
- paths in scripts all relative to the top project directory


##Directory structure
- data = data-like things including the supp mat from the paper and anything else that take a long time to make
- scripts = data-like things including the supp mat from the paper. Make a new directory under /data using the SITE.SUBSITE.PI naming convention (if the raw data contain >1 subite, ok to leave off subsite)
- plots = don't exist yet
